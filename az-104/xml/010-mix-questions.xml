<name><text>Your company’s Azure subscription includes Azure virtual machines (VMs) that run Windows Server 2016. One of the VMs is backed up every day using Azure Backup Instant Restore. When the VM becomes infected with data encrypting ransomware, you are required to restore the VM. Which of the following actions should you take?</text></name>
<generalfeedback format="html"><text><![CDATA[<h5><strong>Explanation:</strong></h5><p>When a VM is infected with ransomware, you should not restore the VM to the infected VM. This is because the ransomware will still be present on the VM, and it will encrypt the files again.<br/>You should also not restore the VM to any VM within the company&#39;s subscription. This is because the ransomware could spread to other VMs in the subscription.<br/>The best way to restore a VM that is infected with ransomware is to restore it to a new Azure VM. This will ensure that the ransomware is not present on the new VM.</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>
