We maintain an equivalent of 3 copies (replicas) of your data within the primary location as described in our SOSP paper; this ensures that we can recover from common failures (disk, node, rack) without impacting your storage accountâ€™s availability and durability.<br/><br/>Box 2: Access tier<br/>Change the access tier from Hot to Cool.<br/><br/>Note: Azure storage offers different access tiers, which allow you to store blob object data in the most cost- effective manner. The available access tiers include:<br/><br/>Hot - Optimized for storing data that is accessed frequently.<br/>Cool - Optimized for storing data that is infrequently accessed and stored for at least 30 days.<br/>Archive - Optimized for storing data that is rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days with flexible latency requirements (on the order of hours).</p>]]></text></generalfeedback>
